- Test 1:
I modified the display of the parent elements, merging them into 1. I assigned sizes to be able to use the key: background position, which was ideal to overcome this part.
For the extra task, to add the link, reviewing the css code base I realized that there was a class called "hero-link", so I deduced that it was an applicable style, I used it and it worked great.

- Test 2:
Using CSS grid, I was able to define the columns and rows I needed, and which ones each element should cover, keeping in mind the responsive model when switching devices.

- Test 3:
I overwrote the HTML so that this section would only use the existing native classes based on the 12 browser columns, and not CSS grid. So that it would support all devices without losing quality.

- I think the most complicated thing was not being able to edit the original CSS file, since that file had some flaws, and I had to fix them by overwriting it in other copies, which is not so recommended in terms of optimization. But in this case it was what was requested and it was fulfilled üëç.
